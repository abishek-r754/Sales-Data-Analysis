Sales Data Analysis

This is a simple data analysis project using Python, MySQL, and Pandas.

I connected Python with MySQL database, fetched data using query, and did basic analysis like total sales by product. I also created a bar chart using matplotlib to show the results.

Tools Used:
- Python
- MySQL
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

File:
sales_analysis_project.ipynb

Steps:
1. Connected MySQL using mysql.connector
2. Retrieved data from MySQL
3. Loaded it into Pandas DataFrame
4. Did data cleaning and grouped by product
5. Calculated total sales (quantity * price)
6. Visualized using matplotlib bar chart

This project is useful to understand how Python, MySQL and Pandas work together for data analysis.
